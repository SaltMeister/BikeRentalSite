# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Backend API
## Authentication Tokens

Tokens expire after a day from when the token is created.

## /bikes

# GET request

Performing a GET request to /bikes will return all available bikes from the database.
Optionally, you can provide a bikeID argument to get the data for a specific bike.
fetch <API URL>/bikes/bikeID?=<ID>
The API will return a json list with the data for each available bike listing

# POST request

Performing a POST request at /bikes will create a new bike listing on the database.
It will require json data passed in specifying the model, price, and image for the listing.


## /rent
# GET request

A get request will pass in the bike id in the url and return json that holds the bike id, its availability, and if the action was successful.


# POST request

Send a post request with json content and the body should contain the bike id and user id to associate with it

The api will rent the bike to the specified user, filling the rented out bike for the user.
The bike will be set to taken and have the userID associated with it.


## /login

# POST request

Pass in json data that contains the email, and password.
The server will search the database for a match and return a new auth token if successful.

The return json will also have a reason for why it failed.

## /authenticate

# POST request

Used for user token authentication.
Use Json to pass in the token that is stored on the user's browser.
Server will validate the token and find a match, it will also check to see if it has expired or not. 
Will return a success: true or false.
